# LDMX rotation and shifts
Rotation and maps:
Include v13 rotated cellmodule.txt cellmap for Particle Net, and 
a script map_cellmodule.cxx that outputs two files: cellmodule.txt and a pdf image what cellmodule.txt looks like physically (cell center location of the whole Ecal face)

Acceptance studies:
Corner studies: take the ratio of how much each geometry gains/looses particle acceptance at corners.

In progress layer shift:
